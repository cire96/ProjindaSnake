# Snakeley

## What all this is about
We have created a game that runs in the browser.

The main conscept of the game is to have a snake that grows as it eats fruit, much like the old Nokia and nostalgic Nokia-game.
Our version, however, implements a feature of playing two people against eachother or as a single player, and also a goal wich the user is supposed to reach.

## How-to
This is the guide on how to run the program on your device.

### Fix a server
To be able to run the Phaser-program you need to install a local server.

#### Windows
Install WAMP or other bundle installer to get a local server on your device.
#### OS X
Install MAMP or use [this manual guide to set up a server](https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-3083)

### Clone Git and put them right
Clone the Git-repo and put the somewhere.

**For most of the bundle installers mentioned above you probably need to put the git-map somewhere to be able to run it on the server.**

### Localhost
Go to your webbrowser and write this:

`http://localhost/projindaSnake`
